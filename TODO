*** Support that in scripts

** TODO Add `invmass' to cloth points
   To allow for fixed points.


* Scripts
** TODO Create script proxy for Cloth and Cloth::Point


* Rendering
** TODO Visualize planes
*** Move out the "rectangular grid mesh" entity as a separate class
*** Consult the "matrix to rotate one vector to another" paper

** TODO More fancy rendering options
*** Calculate normals and texcoords for cloth
	..but don't compute what isn't needed for the current rendering method.
*** Shaders
